# CGPA-SGPA Calculator Project

## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive solution for calculating CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) for students. It is designed to offer a user-friendly interface on the frontend and a robust, efficient backend to handle the calculations. The project is structured into two main components: the backend, which processes the data and performs the calculations, and the frontend, which presents an interactive interface to the users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- A suitable text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like VSCode

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CGPA-SGPA-CALC.git
cd CGPA-SGPA-CALC


#### Set up the backend:

- Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
- Install the required packages: `npm install`
- Start the backend server: `npm start`

#### Set up the frontend:

- Navigate to the frontend directory from the root: `cd frontend`
- Install the necessary packages: `npm install`
- Launch the frontend application: `npm start`

## Backend

### Environment Setup

- `.env`: Holds configuration like database URLs, secret keys, etc. Ensure this file is properly set up with the necessary environment variables before starting the server.

### Source Code (`src`)

- Contains the core logic for handling CGPA and SGPA calculations.
- Organized into modules for maintainability and ease of understanding.

## Frontend

### Public Directory (`public`)

- Stores static files like `index.html`, images, and other assets necessary for the frontend.

### Source Code (`src`)

- Contains React components and other JavaScript files that make up the user interface.
- Organized to support easy navigation and modularity.
